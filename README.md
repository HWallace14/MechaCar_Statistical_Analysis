## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After looking at the results of my linear regression model for the MechaCar data (see below) it appears that vehicle length and ground clearance are the two factors that provide a non-random amount of variance when it comes to mpg values.

The slope of the linear model is not zero because the results for vehicle length and ground clearance are not zero. 

This model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes fairly effectively, as evidenced by the R-squared value being .7149.
